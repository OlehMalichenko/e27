We founded our service in 2017 to simplify the sales process using cold email. 

More promises in sales technologies rather than actions,

Automatization that diminishes the human approach in sales and causes just a reactive attitude,

And sales instruments that are focused solely on solving complicated workflows which affect our entire workday of salesmen.

We have noticed a strong need for a completely new way of solving such tasks which require new kind of company as well. That was the reason we have built Remail.io.

Our main difference from the competitor it personal approach for every customer, an optimal price list and uninterrupted sending letters from your mailbox which emulate your work

Here in Remail.io. we are focused on providing the assistance that many other sales instruments promise but hardly ever deliver – real helping technologies that enable you to work smarter and level up your effectiveness in sales.

",https://www.facebook.com/san.draw.3dprinting,michaellu@sandraw.co,,San Draw breaks through the limitations and customization capabilities of conventional 3D printers with the San Draw FAM-3D™Printer—creating affordable silicone objects of any color and any hardness.,"Professional users of 3D printing, such as shoe manufacturers and medical device developers need highly customizable elastomeric products that can be produced quickly and affordably. Consumers and DIY hobbyists are looking for affordable and high-quality 3D printers that can produce highly flexible and durable objects with adjustable hardness for their projects.

The San Draw FAM-3D™ Printer is the world’s first elastomer 3D printer with full-color and multi-color functions, widest range of elasticity, and multi-material in a single process. This new technology brings time-to-market and reduced tooling costs for both professional and consumer solutions. 

Similarly-featured printers cost $200,000 more than San Draw’s. Our cost of material is 20% of competitors’, and regular on-site maintenance is no more needed because of the ingenuity of our technology.  

3D printing is a rapidly growing global market that is expected to grow from US$4 billion globally in 2014 to over US$49 billion by 2025. Applications of focus are also promising: orthotic insoles ($2.5B in 20142), wearable ($12.6B in 20183), and polymer implants ($1B in 20134). 

San Draw licenses specific part (color, elasticity, or material) of FAM 3D printing technology to footwear and medical corporations, and we sell elastomer 3D printer to corporations and individuals. We also utilize San Draw’s printer to develop patented medical devices, and sell it to medical institutions. San Draw’s beta-version intravenous injection trainer (IIT) is already an innovative product which outshines current ones in performance and price. Though the revenue of IIT is only 1% of us, its high margin (90%) leaves room for global distribution.

San Draw was founded by two Stanford University alumni, Gary Chang and Michael Lu, with backgrounds in Material Science and Mechanical Engineering. San Draw has become a 7-person team in 2016, composed of professionals in hardware, software, and industrial design."

http://www.facebook.com/finhop",support@finhop.com,,Finhop makes online shopping easy and seamless by providing a single search platform for all the Singapore online shops listed in Finhop Network.,"Founded in August 2015, Finhop started off as a search engine specifically tailored for ecommerce where users are able to search for any products from over 30 (and still counting) online shops in Singapore. The idea is very simple: enter keywords for the products which you are searching and Finhop will instantly list down all the relevant products from all the online shops listed in Finhop.

Finhop becomes the solution for a very common online shopping behavior: people always like to search and compare products from one website to another but usually it takes too much effort and time that they end up with the second best offer or, worse, not buying because they cannot find the products. Typically, online shoppers only search through 3-5 online shops in their products pursuit and whatever results given will be accepted (including when they cannot find the products). Finhop, however, will not limit the shoppers to the only online shops which they can remember at the moment of pursuit. Finhop will list down all the shops which sell the products in pursuit, enhancing the shoppers’ ability to browse through online shops by multiple folds. With less effort. And less time.

The search results provided by Finhop are listed based on relevancy by their algorithm and are linked directly to each of the products’ pages on the corresponding online shops, making it extremely easy and seamless for the online shoppers to browse through products from one shop to another. Finhop also makes it possible for online shoppers to bookmark products which interest them and to share the products to their Facebook.

At the moment, Finhop still puts heavy focus on improving the our algorithm in order to deliver the best search results for products online and also on creating more features to support this search functionality with the ultimate goal to make online shopping easier and more seamless for online shoppers in Singapore."

It is popular and successful with well over 20 million registered users. On average, 542 people marry every day in the U.S. as a result of being matched on eHarmony, or 4.8% of new marriages (Harris, 2010).

eHarmony's matching system determines members' compatibility with others based on their values, character, intellect, humor, religious/spiritual beliefs and many other dimensions. In all, it analyzes 29 dimensions of compatibility and synthesizes matches using an algorithm built on 35 years of clinical research.

At eHarmony, we've never shied away from big challenges. We came together in 2000 believing that with a mix of psychology and some cutting edge technology, we could create relationships that were happier, more fulfilling and enduring.

It's not in their nature to brag, but as they say, the numbers don't lie. With over 61 million registered users, they've successfully married more than 565,000 couples, and are responsible for nearly 5% of marriages in the US - that's 438 people every day that say ""I Do"" because of eHarmony. They had so much success at home that we decided to expand their service internationally, launching country specific sites in Canada, Australia and the UK. 

Currently, eHarmony operates online matchmaking services in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and Brazil."

But booking travel plans can become costly and tedious - comparing prices from multiple sites, expensive travel agency fees, last minute changes, cancelled flights, etc.

TripClub takes care of a company's business travel needs, so they can spend their time on what really matters—growing the business.

Through its online platform, companies can manage all  trip bookings in one place and have access to discounted rates from over 500,000 hotels and 900 airlines worldwide. Its 24-hour travel concierge can help you end-to-end booking and assist should they need to make any changes or cancellations. This saves them at least 10% of their travel budget as well as saves them time and energy.

It has been an exciting six months since we launched our MVP to the market and here are some of the highlights:

We have validated that travel management for small and medium enterprises and large local companies is our core focus.

In line with this thrust we have successfully onboarded close to 40 clients.

Part of our client roster now includes some of the biggest local companies like Ayala Land and its subsidiaries, National Grid Corporation, Philamlife Asset Management, Asia United Bank,  Golden ABC/Penshoppe.

We are also the official travel partner of the Ayala Group Acentives employee program. This is for all employees under the group (BPI, Globe, Ayala Corp, Honda Cars, etc)

We have forged partnerships as well with other employee marketplaces like Storm Benefits, Venteny and Giftaway. 

Our revenue reflects the growth that we are experiencing and we are on track to 10x our average monthly revenue by August 2018, a year after our MVP launch. This will get us to a break even state by end of the year as well.

For this month, we are confident to break the USD 50,000 revenue milestone we set for ourselves

This use case is currently underserved by Google search because it is not optimized for social media content and does not return relevant search results. They address this issue by aggregating thousands of merchants and allowing users to quickly filter through them on the basis of style and trust. 

PROBLEM
It is exceedingly difficult to find online shops in social commerce markets because (1) there are thousands of them,and (2) Google search is not optimized for social media content. Unlike conventional web content, Facebook and Instagram pages are essentially limited to only the URL, page title, and the “About” description as a means of performing SEO. As a result, Google searches for social media shops returns hundreds of random links with very little relevance to the user’s search objective. For example, a shopper can key in a search for “selling clothes on Facebook” and browse through 20 pages of search results without ever encountering even one of the Top 5 most popular and trusted shops in the country.

SOLUTION
STYLHUNT aggregates and indexes thousands of social media merchants,and allows shoppers to quickly filter through them on the basis of style and trust. Style is assessed visually through search result images representing each merchant’s product selection. Trust is assessed through ranking by total Likes or Follows (indicating community trust) and Friend Likes (indicating trust from the user’s personal network). Users can save favorite merchants and products to a wish list or collection of visual bookmarks for future reference.

With its name synonymous to “talk to us”, Doc2Us is a mobile application that allows you to talk to a doctor or any healthcare professionals via text chat at any time and from anywhere.

Why Doc2Us?

We often find ourselves desperate for a professional medical practitioner’s advice at a time when it seems most inconvenient. Troublesome symptoms that make us question their severity and if relied solely on the internet, we can almost be certain that it is the bleakest ailment that has struck us. The question that always seem to be lingering on our minds are: How severe is the situation and which doctor should I seek opinion from?

However, the idea of braving the weather and traffic, proceeding to find a car park, before joining others in the long queue then finally paying expensive consultation fees just to ask a simple question “What is wrong with me?” is barely worth the effort. Here’s where Doc2Us comes into play – connecting you to a healthcare professional and get advice instantly via a simple platform."
